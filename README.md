# MLV8
## A C improvement over MBOA8

## What is MLV8
MLV8 (Mini Low-level Von Neumann 8 bit) is the C improvment and continuation of my [MBOA8](https://github.com/MOHAPY24/MBOA8) CPU Emulator.
MLV8 improves on MBOA8 by using C instead of Python for preformance, a more minimal and neuanced [instruction set](instructions.md).

## Architecture

Based on the Von Neumann architechture, where instructions and data are stored in the same memory unit. In-tern making the CPU very minimal and simple.
